# COMP333HW5

Wesleyan University COMP333 HW5 -- Ari Eaton and Richard Lourie

Problem 1 Instructions:

1. cd into the COMP333HW5/problem1 directory
2. run 'pytyon3 unit_testing.py' in the terminal

Problem 2 Instructions:

1. cd into the COMP333HW5/problem2 directory
2. run 'pytest test_pytest.py' in the terminal

Problem 3:
I installed Composer, then phpunit. To run my tests, place the contents of the backend folder into the htdocs folder of XAMPP and then start your servers, then cd into problem3 folder and run ./vendor/bin/phpunit backendtests.php in terminal.

Problem 4:
cd into the problem4/hw3 directory. there is no need to copy the previous react repo, as it is all stored in this file. from there, run npm test. 5 tests should run and pass for our login.js component, which is also our signup page.

Problem 6:
ChatGPT can be used to write tests. I used it to write code for problem 1. I gave it the full homework prompt (including the provided code) and it generated the code that we have in our problem 1 folder.
